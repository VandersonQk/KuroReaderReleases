### What is the Order ID?
The Order ID is a code that identifies each purchase on the Play Store, usually in the format: GPA.1234-1234-1234-12345.

### Where can I find my Order ID?
You can find the Order ID in the email receipt of your purchase on the Play Store. Simply search for "Kuro Reader" in your email to find the receipt.

### What is the device ID?
The device ID is a unique code used to identify your device, you can find it in the activation key screen. ([Screenshot](img/screenshots/device_id.jpg))

### I couldn't find my Order ID, what should I do?
Please contact us directly via the support email using the email you used for the purchase. We will manually check the Play Store system and send you the Order ID.

### Why do we limit the number of activations?
We limit activations to prevent the sharing of Order IDs, ensuring that our system does not become overloaded and can generate keys for all legitimate app purchasers.

### Why the key have an expiration date?
Because we don't want a key permanently linked to the device. When the key expires, you can create a new one for the same or another device. If you just want to test the app, generate a 1-day key, or a longer-lasting key for daily use.   

### Why is the app not available on the Play Store?
The app was banned (unfairly) due to the use of copyrighted material in one of the store's screenshots. Details are available in [this blog post](https://kurotoshiro.com.br/kuro-reader-ban/).

### Will the app return to the Play Store?
Yes. The app itself does not violate any rules.

### Google Drive services are not working
Currently, the app does not have access to Google's APIs because they were directly linked to the Play Store system, which signed the app. This signature tells to the Google Drive system/API that the app is legitimate. We plan to restore this access in the coming weeks after re-releasing the app on the Play Store.

### Are the APKs safe?
We guarantee that the APKs downloaded directly from our GitHub page are safe and have been verified. You can manually verify the app through the [Virus Total](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload) website.
